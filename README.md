Project Title: Heart Health Prediction using Logistic Regression
Introduction
The Heart Health Prediction project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on several health-related features using Logistic Regression.

Dataset
Source: https://github.com/SNaveen5698/Heart-Health-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning/blob/main/heart.csv
Description: The dataset contains various health-related features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc., along with the target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.
Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Check for and handle any missing values in the dataset.
Data Scaling: Standardize numerical features using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity in feature scales.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize the distribution of key features using histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices to understand feature relationships and identify patterns.
Model Training
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy_score on the test set.
Results
Model Accuracy: Display the accuracy achieved by the Logistic Regression model on the test data.
Prediction Example: Provide an example prediction using new data inputs.
Conclusion
The Heart Health Prediction project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression to predict heart disease risk based on health-related attributes. The model achieved a 86% accuracy on the test set, indicating its potential for accurate heart health predictions.
