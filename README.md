Project Title: Heart Health Prediction using Logistic Regression
Summary
The Heart Health Prediction project utilizes Logistic Regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on health-related features. The dataset includes attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, with the target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values in the dataset.
Standardize numerical features using StandardScaler.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize feature distributions using histograms and box plots.
Analyze feature correlations using correlation matrices.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy_score on the test set.
Achievements
Achieved an 86% accuracy with the Logistic Regression model on the test data.
Demonstrated the model's potential for accurate heart health predictions based on health-related attributes.
